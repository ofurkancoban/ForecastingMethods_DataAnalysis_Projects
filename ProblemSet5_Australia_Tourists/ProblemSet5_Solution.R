# 1. Create  a  R  script  file  library  required  packages  and  use  R  data  set  calledaustourists. ----

# 2. Create a time series object beginning 2005. Hint: use window command. ----

# 3. Graph and explain with respect to the components of a time series. ----

plot(ts_data)

decomposed_ts <- decompose(ts_data)

# 4. Which model would be appropriate. ----

# ETS or Holt-Winters

# 5. Use both additive and multiplicative Holtâ€™s Winter approach. ----

hw_additive <- hw(ts_data, seasonal="additive")
hw_multiplicative <- hw(ts_data, seasonal="multiplicative")

# 6. Compare the two models using RMSE, which model is the best fit. ----

# 7. Compute by R (using the formula) forecast for 2016-2017 ----
